/// two. That is why decision 9 of
/// `docs/plans/2026-07-25-rendezvous-placement.md` deletes the old
/// `with_preferred_writer_node` override rather than keeping it as a pin.
///
/// `ROUTE` always names the whole live fleet. Routers have to stay redundant: a
/// driver that cannot reach one router must be able to ask another, and it is
/// the `ROUTE` list it re-fetches from after invalidating a dead reader.
///
/// # `READ` is one address, or the whole fleet — never a preference order
///
/// [`BoltReadRouting`] picks between the two. Every node can read any cell, so
/// [`Fleet`] is correct and was the only behaviour until
/// `docs/plans/2026-08-21-cell-affine-read-routing.md`; it is also the reason
/// reads that follow a write on another node spend 17–38s polling their own
/// manifest until it catches up, because `durable_sequence()` is free on the
/// writer and a poll loop everywhere else. [`Owner`] hands `READ` the same
/// single address `WRITE` gets — resolved once, above, so `READ` follows the
/// *lease* holder through a handoff exactly as `WRITE` does rather than
/// re-deriving raw rendezvous.
///
/// In [`Owner`] mode `READ` must be **exactly one address**, never the owner
/// plus fallbacks. A Neo4j driver load-balances across every address in a role
/// (least-connected by default); it does not read the list as an ordered
/// preference. An owner-plus-fallback list would send most reads back to
/// non-owners and buy nothing. The cost of that is real and named in the plan:
/// when the owner dies, the query in flight fails through to the application
/// un-retried, where before it was one of three nodes' worth of failures.
///
/// # Liveness comes from the shared placement view, not from a probe
///
/// This used to fan out a `/readyz` probe to every configured node on every
/// routing refresh and advertise the reachable ones. Decision 4 deletes that
/// fan-out, and the reason is **consistency, not cost**: a probe is computed
/// per caller, so two drivers asking at the same instant could get different
/// answers, and rendezvous only converges if every reader derives ownership
/// from the *same* live set. One object-store LIST behind one
/// [`PlacementView`] gives that; N probes cannot. The `/readyz` endpoint
/// itself is untouched — the k8s readiness probe, the runtime smoke script and
/// the Jepsen harness still use it; only routing stopped calling it.
