//! Reproduces the "MATCH + CREATE is not supported by the mutation engine"
//! limitation reported against the graph-node write engine.
//!
//! The HTTP query API and the Bolt path both classify a write query and then
//! hand it to `parse_opencypher_mutation_query_with_parameters` to decide
//! whether the mutation engine can execute it (see
//! `src/client/service.rs` -> "write query is not executable by the mutation
//! engine"). That parser is the exact decision point, so we exercise it
//! directly here — no object store, no server, no I/O — and print the verdict
//! for each query shape called out in the report.
//!
//!   just check-examples        # or, to actually run it:
//!   cargo run --example match_create_repro --features opencypher
//!
//! A query is executable by the mutation engine iff the parser returns
//! `Ok(Some(_))`. `Ok(None)` is what the client turns into
//! "write query is not executable by the mutation engine"; `Err(_)` is a
//! specific unsupported-feature rejection surfaced verbatim to the caller.
